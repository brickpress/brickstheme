* Content Section     - sets the style for your content boxes.
* Sidebars Section    - when setting an image as custom background, your primary sidebar text may not stand out, thus difficult to read. If so, 	                        you can try increase the primary widget background opacity or change it's color altogether. 
* Social Section      - add your social network profiles. This also lets you add webmaster tools meta data if you haven't done so already.
* Footer Section      - set footer logo, copyright notice and a site badge or a wide ad banner.
* Layout Section      - exlpore advanced styling options. Try setting background images for sections with wrappers, manipulate opacity to reveal 		                        images in the background, or just about anything you can imagine.
* Reset Section       - resets theme settings to defaults. This does not reset text entries such as copyright notice, Creative Commons license,                        and footer ads.
