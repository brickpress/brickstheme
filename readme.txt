== Description ==

Cubricks theme is a fully responsive theme inspired by TwentyTwelve Theme for WordPress. Featuring the new theme customizer, you can transform your website into almost anything you can imagine. It includes a featured post slider, ten widget areas, five page-templates and supports post formats, custom header and background.

Since version 1.0.6, Cubricks theme options were implemented into the Theme Customizer. It is much easier to use and offers live preview. Theme options sections are now in the theme customizer panel.

Changes the color of text elements such as the site title, site description, post title, headings, link color, primary and secondary text colors.
* Text Shadows
Give your website that elegant look you commonly find on premium themes with text shadows.
* Wrappers Section
Put your creativity to the test with Cubricks theme section wrappers. Each section wrapper can be styled independently using a combination of colors, opacity, background images and background positioning. You can transform your website into almost anything you can imagine using this feature.
